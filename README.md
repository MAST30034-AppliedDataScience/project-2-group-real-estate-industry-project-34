# Repository Overview:
Files with scrape in its name are used for scraping data from domain

Files with 'preprocessing' and 'cleaning' includes the steps we did to preprocess our data.

Files with 'join' includes our joining process of our data. 

Files with 'model' includes our model used to predict growth and demand. 

Files with 'mapping' are used to create geospatial maps of our data.

# How to get the Project started:

Run our notebooks in numerical order, using the numbers in front of the file names as guidelines
