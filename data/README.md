# Project Documentation

## Introduction
- **Target Audience**:  
  This project is intended for data scientists, analysts, and real estate developers who aim to analyze and predict income, population trends, and affluence in various suburbs across Victoria, Australia.
  
- **Sources**:  
  The data used in this project includes:
  - Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS) income data for regions (`ABS_Income_including_government_allowances_by_2021_SA2_Nov_2023.csv` and `au-govt-abs-abs-data-by-region-income-asgs-sa2-2011-2019-sa2-2016.csv`).
  - Demographic data from the ABS (`33010DO002_2022_ST_AUST.xlsx`) for population and fertility.
  - Shapefile data (`SA2_2021_AUST_GDA2020.shp`) for geographic boundaries of Statistical Areas Level 2 (SA2).

- **Aim**:  
  The objective of this project is to clean and merge income and population data with geographic shapefiles, handle missing values using machine learning techniques, forecast population and income trends, compute affluence scores, and provide insights into future demographic and economic conditions in Victoria.

## Datasets: Crime, Income, Fertility (Population), Rental

1. **Years**:  
   - **Income Data**: Data spans 2011 to 2020 for personal income, including various forms of earnings such as employee income, investment income, and government allowances.
   - **Population Data**: Data includes population estimates, fertility rates, and births from 2011 to 2022.

2. **Preprocessing**:
   - **Income Data**: Columns with more than 50% missing data were removed. Missing numeric values were imputed using Random Forest Regressor, and rows with null values were dropped.
   - **Population Data**: Missing values were imputed using median values for fertility rates in earlier years. The dataset was cleaned, and columns were renamed to reflect demographic metrics across years.
   - **Geographic Data**: Shapefile data was merged with income and population datasets using the common `Statistical Areas Level 2 2021 code`.

3. **Feature Engineering**:
   - **Income Data**: Features related to personal income, investment income, superannuation, and government allowances were used for analysis. After cleaning, the dataset was standardized for PCA.
   - **Population Data**: Features such as population estimates, birth rates, and fertility rates across years were used to forecast future population trends.

4. **Feature Importance**:
   - **Income Data**: Correlation analysis and Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) were used to select significant features for income prediction, with PCA applied to reduce dimensionality.
   - **Population Data**: Population and fertility rates were key features used for time series forecasting using the ARIMA model.

5. **Prediction of Future Data (Insights)**:
   - **Income Data**: Linear Regression and PCA were used to predict income trends and compute affluence scores. Forecasts for median income in different suburbs were generated, with affluence scores identifying the most affluent suburbs in Victoria.
   - **Population Data**: ARIMA forecasting predicted population growth for 2023 and 2024, with insights indicating potential future population changes for individual suburbs and the entire state of Victoria.

## Model

1. **Model Type Used**:  
   - **Income Data**:
     - Random Forest Regressor: Used for imputing missing values.
     - Principal Component Analysis (PCA): Applied to reduce dimensionality and identify key features explaining 90% of the variance.
     - Linear Regression: Used to predict both median income and affluence scores based on selected features and principal components.
     - Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE): Used for feature selection.
   - **Population Data**:
     - ARIMA (Auto-Regressive Integrated Moving Average): Used for forecasting population growth for future years.

2. **Features Used**:  
   - **Income Data**: 
     - Personal income metrics including `Personal income: Employee income`, `Personal income: Superannuation income`, `Personal income: Investment income`, and others related to government pensions and allowances.
     - Features were reduced to 11 principal components using PCA, explaining 90% of the variance.
   - **Population Data**: 
     - Population estimates, birth rates, and fertility rates from 2011 to 2022 were used to forecast future population growth.
   - **Geographic Data**: 
     - Geographic boundaries from the SA2 shapefile were used to merge the datasets and create region-based forecasts.

## Affluence Score Insights

1. **Affluence Score Calculation**:  
   - The affluence score was calculated using PCA and Linear Regression, leveraging income data from 2020.
   - The top 10 suburbs with the highest affluence scores include:
     - **Carlton**
     - **Toorak**
     - **Doncaster**
     - **Box Hill**
     - **Glen Waverley - East**
   - Affluence scores were aggregated by suburb to identify the most affluent regions in Victoria.

2. **Median Income Prediction**:  
   - Median income for each suburb was predicted using Linear Regression on selected principal components from the PCA model.
   - Forecasts for years 2011, 2014, 2015, 2016, and 2017 were generated based on income data trends.

3. **Population Forecasting**:  
   - Using ARIMA, population growth was forecasted for the years 2023 and 2024. Historical data from 2011 to 2022 was used to train the model, and additional insights were generated for both individual suburbs and the overall population trends in Victoria.

## Additional Section (Improvements)

- **Evaluation Metrics**:  
   - **Income Data**: Model performance for income prediction was evaluated using Mean Squared Error (MSE) and RÂ² score. PCA-based feature reduction was validated by assessing the explained variance.
   - **Population Data**: The ARIMA model can be further validated by comparing predicted and actual values for years 2021 and 2022.

- **Visualization**:  
   - Cumulative explained variance was plotted for PCA to decide the number of principal components to retain. Additional visualizations, such as heatmaps of affluence scores and population trends across suburbs, would enhance the understanding of data distribution.
   
- **Further Feature Engineering**:  
   Additional factors such as real estate prices, migration data, and socio-economic indicators could be incorporated to further improve the affluence model and population forecast. Additionally, future models can benefit from including long-term historical income and population trends to enhance predictions.
